--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. AIM:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To explore the properties of Python lists, including indexing, slicing, mutability, built-in list methods (append, insert, extend, remove), and the application of aggregate functions for data analysis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. THEORY:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A List in Python is a versatile, ordered, and mutable collection of items. Unlike arrays in other languages, Python lists can store heterogeneous data types. Key concepts include:

Indexing & Slicing: Accessing elements via zero-based indices or extracting sub-sections using the [start:stop] syntax.

Mutability: The ability to change, add, or remove elements after the list has been created.

Built-in Methods: Functions like .append() (add to end), .insert() (add at specific index), and .extend() (concatenate another list).

Aggregate Functions: Using max(), min(), and sum() to perform quick statistical calculations on numeric lists.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. LOGIC:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The implementation is divided into three logical segments:

List Manipulation: Demonstrating how lists can combine multiple data types and how negative indexing allows for accessing elements from the end of the collection.

Statistical Analysis: Using a list of student marks to calculate performance metrics (Maximum, Minimum, Average) and organizing data using the .sort() method.

Dynamic Updates: Simulating a real-world scenario (Grocery List) where items are added and removed dynamically to reflect changing requirements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. ALGORITHM (Grocery List Management):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Initialize a list named Grocery with five predefined string elements.

Step 3: Use the .append() method to add "Bananas" and "Flour" to the list.

Step 4: Display the updated list to the console.

Step 5: Use the .remove() method to delete specific items ("Apples" and "Bread") based on their values.

Step 6: Display the final modified list.

Step 7: End.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CONCLUSION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Through this experiment, I successfully implemented various list operations in Python. I observed how lists handle dynamic data, allowing for seamless expansion and contraction. The use of slicing and aggregate functions proved to be highly efficient for data retrieval and basic analysis. This experiment reinforces that lists are one of the most powerful and flexible tools for data storage in Python.
